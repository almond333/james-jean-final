           If you’re an artist, then your practice should be a daily thing. When observed like a concept that you pursue every single day, there is unavoidably something mechanical and unemotional about that process. James Jean is a young Taiwanese-American artist, who understands that no matter how much the practice becomes similar to repetition, we’re still humans in the end. He thinks of his body as a mechanical vehicle fueled by his emotions, whatever they may be – anger, hate, subdue, or sorrow. The biggest fear for James Jean is getting crippled by some sort of depression and not be able to get up and create every day.
